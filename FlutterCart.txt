Nice 👍 You want to go ahead with the **E-Commerce App** idea. Let’s break down the roadmap for **ShopEasy / FlutterCart / BuySmart** so you can practice Flutter and Firebase properly.

# 🛒 **E-Commerce App – Roadmap**

---

## 🔹 **Phase 1: Setup**

1. **Create Flutter Project**

   ```bash
   flutter create shop_easy
   cd shop_easy
   ```
2. **Add Firebase**

   * Install FlutterFire CLI → `dart pub global activate flutterfire_cli`
   * Configure Firebase → `flutterfire configure`
   * Enable **Authentication** (Email/Google), **Cloud Firestore**, **Firebase Storage**.

---

## 🔹 **Phase 2: Authentication**

**Goal:** Users can register/login.

* Firebase Auth (Email + Google Sign-In).
* Store user details in Firestore (`users/{uid}` collection).
* Profile screen (name, email, avatar).

---

## 🔹 **Phase 3: Product Catalog**

**Goal:** Show products from Firestore.

* Create `products` collection in Firestore.
  Example fields: `name, description, price, imageUrl, stock`.
* Display products in a **Grid/List view**.
* Implement **search & filter** by category.

---

## 🔹 **Phase 4: Cart & Wishlist**

* **Cart:**

  * Add/remove items.
  * Quantity increment/decrement.
  * Show total price.
  * Store in Firestore under user (`users/{uid}/cart`).

* **Wishlist:**

  * Users can mark favorite products.
  * Store under `users/{uid}/wishlist`.

---

## 🔹 **Phase 5: Checkout & Orders**

* **Checkout Flow:**

  * Select items from cart → Proceed to checkout.
  * Save order in Firestore (`orders/{orderId}`).
  * Show past orders in "My Orders".

* **Payments (Extra Practice):**

  * Use **Stripe** (international) or **Razorpay** (India).
  * Test with sandbox mode.

---

## 🔹 **Phase 6: Admin Panel**

**Goal:** Admin can add/manage products.

* Separate **admin login**.
* Add/Edit/Delete product.
* Upload product images to Firebase Storage.

---

## 🔹 **Phase 7: UI & Polish**

* **Bottom Navigation Bar** (Home, Cart, Wishlist, Orders, Profile).
* **Dark Mode toggle**.
* Animations (`hero`, `page_transition`).
* Push Notifications (`firebase_messaging`) for order status.

---

## 🔹 **Phase 8: Deployment**

1. Add **App Icon & Splash Screen**.

   * `flutter_launcher_icons`
   * `flutter_native_splash`
2. Build app:

   ```bash
   flutter build apk
   flutter build appbundle
   ```
3. Upload to Play Store.

---

✅ End result = A **realistic shopping app** with:

* Authentication 🔑
* Product Catalog 📦
* Cart & Wishlist 🛒
* Orders 📜
* Payments 💳
* Admin Panel 🛠️

👉 Would you like me to **create the folder structure + sample code (Authentication + Product Catalog)** so you can start building **ShopEasy** step by step?
